# Usage
The app can be used with out without supervision, but could be also used as a tool for therapists. The application relies on the honesty of the user.

# Monitoring
The performance of the tasks is monitored by the heart beat. After each finished task the user is asked to assess her own performance in a 0 to 10 scale. Note: We discarded the idea of monitoring the voice, due to the bad results of emotional classification of voice data.

# Prerequisites
In order to utilize the heart beat monitoring, the user needs a Microsoft Band. Connect this device in the `Connect` menu.
